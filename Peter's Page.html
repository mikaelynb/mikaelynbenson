<div> Burger King Foot Lettuce refers to a scandal in which a Burger King employee was photographed standing in two plastic tubs of lettuce with shoes on. Shortly after its initial appearance on 4chan, the location of the Burger King restaurant was subsequently identified and the photograph in question was sent to local and national news outlets, ultimately resulting in the termination of the employee. In late 2017, 4chan's doxing story resurfaced on the social media after a dramatic retelling of the episode went viral on YouTube and became a subject of copypastas, remixes and parodies.</div>
